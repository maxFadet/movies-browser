This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application features a clean and responsive UI, powered by `styled-components`, with dynamic routing handled by `React Router` and state management achieved through `Redux` and `Redux-Saga`. The application is styled using a theme, allowing for consistent design across all components.

## API

This application uses the [TMDb API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) to fetch data about movies and actors. The API provides a vast amount of information about films, including ratings, reviews, cast details, and more. Integration with TMDb allows the app to stay up-to-date with the latest movies and trends.
